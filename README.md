# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on developing a
handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST
dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark
dataset in the field of machine learning and computer
vision. The primary goal of this project is to build and
train a neural network model that can accurately classify
handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
